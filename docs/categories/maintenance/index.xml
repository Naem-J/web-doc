      <title>Microscope Alignment</title>
      <link>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/maintenance/basic/microscope_alignment/</link>

      <guid>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/maintenance/basic/microscope_alignment/</guid>
      <description>Use the microscope controls to focus the image on-screen. If the image still appears out of focus or blurry, check the camera alignment using the crosshair target on the back of the white balance card.
 Put on 3D glasses and ensure a live image is observed on the system. Place the crosshair target face-up on a flat surface. Center the microscope field of view on the crosshair. Align the horizontal and vertical bars with the field of view.</description>
