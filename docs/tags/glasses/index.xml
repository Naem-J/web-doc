      <description>3D images require passive, circularly-polarized 3D glasses. If necessary, wear the 3D glasses over prescription glasses.
CAUTION To ensure optimal image quality, the system should only be used with Alcon-supplied 3D glasses. Contact Alcon if additional pairs are required. Polarized prescription glasses will distort the 3D effect and should not be used. The 3D glasses must be worn in front of the laser protective eyewear to avoid distorting the 3D effect.</description>

      <description>Clean the system by periodically wiping down with a dry, lint-free cloth. Use warm water and mild detergent on non-electrical system components (for example, the cart, exterior cart panels, and 3D glasses). Wipe down the camera and camera cable with isopropyl alcohol. Wipe the display with a soft, dry cloth. Use less than 0.10 lb. of force on the display. Water-based cleaners may damage the coating on the screen.  WARNINGOnly factory-authorized personnel should service the system or system components.</description>

      <description>If the system exhibits the following symptoms, attempt the corresponding troubleshooting procedures before contacting Technical Services.
The image is blurry or out of focus.  Use the microscope controls to focus the image on-screen. Check to see that the camera is flush on the microscope. Wearing the 3D glasses, close one eye at a time to check the right and left eye focus for the camera. Change the camera orientation and note if the issue remains in the same location.</description>
