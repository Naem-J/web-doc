      <description>At a minimum, the system includes the cart, camera, microscope, 3D glasses, keyboard, and touchpad. To optimize operation, incorporate additional devices such as the following:
1 System &amp;ndash; Receives video from the camera and displays 3D images.  2 Patient Bed &amp;ndash; Holds the patient at a comfortable level.  3 Microscope stand &amp;ndash; Suspends a microscope above the patient.  4 Camera &amp;ndash; Captures 3D video.  5 Microscope &amp;ndash; Magnifies the view of the camera.</description>

      <description>The camera is a stereoscopic 3D camera with high dynamic range. Mount the camera on a surgical microscope.
1 Camera &amp;ndash; Captures video from the connected microscope.  2 Strain relief screw &amp;ndash; Holds the camera cable in place to reduce stress on the cable connection.  3 USB camera connector &amp;ndash; Connects the camera to the cart.  4 Iris slider &amp;ndash; Adjusts light exposure captured by the camera. Alcon recommends setting the iris slider to 30%.</description>

      <title>Camera Installation</title>
      <link>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/system_setup/system_assembly/camera_installation/</link>

      <description>WARNINGIn case of emergency, keep the microscope oculars and mounting accessories in the cart top drawer. If there are any concerns regarding the continued safe use of the system, consider returning to the oculars.Mount the camera to a surgical microscope. Depending on the microscope model, install either a Z-ring or L-ring bracket to the camera lens (see the letters in the image below). The Z-ring bracket is for Alcon or Zeiss™ microscopes and the L-ring bracket is for Leica™ microscopes.</description>

      <title>Camera Sensor Initialization</title>
      <link>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/system_setup/camera_configuration/sensor_initialization/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 22:44:37 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/system_setup/camera_configuration/sensor_initialization/</guid>
      <description>Sensor initialization helps prevent image degradation and noise. Perform the following steps during startup or after camera connection. A message to expose the camera to more light appears.
NOTICEImage quality is also influenced by other factors.  Turn on all room lights.
  Open the camera iris to 100%.
  Position the white balance card at 90 degrees under the microscope objective lens. The message disappears within 5 seconds.</description>

      <title>Camera Pan</title>
      <link>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/system_setup/camera_configuration/camera_pan/</link>

      <guid>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/system_setup/camera_configuration/camera_pan/</guid>
      <description>The camera pan function adjusts the alignment of the image without moving the camera or microscope mount. The range of image movement is limited.
The pan function is useful in the following cases:
 In retina cases, where the wide angle lens is not centered in the optical path. In minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures when gonioscopy lens image is not centered in optical path.  Use Ctrl+Up, Ctrl+Right, Ctrl+Down, or Ctrl+Left to electronically move the image.</description>

      <title>White Balance</title>
      <link>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/system_setup/white_balance/</link>

      <guid>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/system_setup/white_balance/</guid>
      <description>To calibrate light settings, verify the light temperature and perform the white balance procedure (see Light Profile Settings). Before setting white balance, perform the following checks:
 Set the camera iris slider to normal working conditions for the user. Alcon recommends 30%. Set the microscope to maximum zoom. Disable any red reflex settings. Remove all extraneous devices (for example, beam splitters or invertors). Disable any unique microscope filtration or lens settings (for example, laser filters).</description>

      <guid>https://naem-j.github.io/web-doc/maintenance/cleaning/</guid>
      <description>Clean the system by periodically wiping down with a dry, lint-free cloth. Use warm water and mild detergent on non-electrical system components (for example, the cart, exterior cart panels, and 3D glasses). Wipe down the camera and camera cable with isopropyl alcohol. Wipe the display with a soft, dry cloth. Use less than 0.10 lb. of force on the display. Water-based cleaners may damage the coating on the screen.  WARNINGOnly factory-authorized personnel should service the system or system components.</description>

      <description>To store or transport the system within the facility, perform the following:
 Route the camera cable.
a. Disconnect the camera cable from the camera.
b. Wrap camera cable around the camera cable coil. Route the power cable.
a. Disconnect the power cable from the outlet.
b. Wrap power cable around the power cable coil. If the system includes a connected DataFusion device, disconnect the cable on the other device.</description>

      <description>If the system exhibits the following symptoms, attempt the corresponding troubleshooting procedures before contacting Technical Services.
The image is blurry or out of focus.  Use the microscope controls to focus the image on-screen. Check to see that the camera is flush on the microscope. Wearing the 3D glasses, close one eye at a time to check the right and left eye focus for the camera. Change the camera orientation and note if the issue remains in the same location.</description>
