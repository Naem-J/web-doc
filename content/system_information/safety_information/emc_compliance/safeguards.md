* All equipment connected to this unit shall be certified according to IEC 60601-1 or other IEC/ISO standards applicable to the equipment.
* Furthermore, all complete configurations shall comply with IEC 60601-1. If the user connects additional equipment to the signal input or signal output, this alters the medical device system, and it is then the userâ€™s responsibility that the system complies with the requirements of the standard IEC 60601-1. If in doubt, contact Alcon Technical Services.
* When this unit is used together with other equipment in the patient area (see Patient Area on page 6), the equipment shall be either powered by an isolation transformer (internal in the system) or connected via an additional protective earth terminal to system ground unless it is certified according to IEC 60601-1.
* The leakage current could increase when connected to other equipment.
* This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy. If it is not installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, it may cause interference to other equipment. If this unit causes interference (which can be determined by unplugging the power cord from the unit), try these measures: relocate the unit with respect to the susceptible equipment and plug this unit and the susceptible equipment into different branch circuits.
* The operator should take precautions to avoid touching any system components and the patient at the same time.
* The system should be positioned so that it is not difficult to disconnect the power plug from the supply mains.
