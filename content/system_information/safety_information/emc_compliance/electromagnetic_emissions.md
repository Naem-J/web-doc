The NGENUITY&trade; system is intended for use in the electromagnetic environments specified below. The customer or the user of the*NGENUITY&trade; system should assure it is used in such an environment.

| Emissions Test | Compliance | Electromagnetic Environment - Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RF Emissions (CISPR 11) | Group 1 | The system uses RF energy only for its internal functions. Therefore, its RF emissions are low and are not likely to cause any interference in nearby electronic equipment. |
| Conducted Emissions (CISPR 11) | Class A | The emissions characteristics of the system make it suitable for use in industrial areas and hospitals (CISPR 11 class A). If it is used in a residential environment (for which CISPR 11 class B is normally required) system might not offer adequate protection to radio-frequency communication services. The user might need to take mitigation measures, such as relocating or re-orienting the equipment. |
| Harmonics Emissions (IEC 61000-3-2) | Class A | The emissions characteristics of the system make it suitable for use in industrial areas and hospitals (CISPR 11 class A). If it is used in a residential environment (for which CISPR 11 class B is normally required) system might not offer adequate protection to radio-frequency communication services. The user might need to take mitigation measures, such as relocating or re-orienting the equipment. |
| Voltage Fluctuations/Flicker Emissions (IEC 61000-3-3) | Complies | The emissions characteristics of the system make it suitable for use in industrial areas and hospitals (CISPR 11 class A). If it is used in a residential environment (for which CISPR 11 class B is normally required) system might not offer adequate protection to radio-frequency communication services. The user might need to take mitigation measures, such as relocating or re-orienting the equipment. |
