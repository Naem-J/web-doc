3D images require passive, circularly-polarized 3D glasses. If necessary, wear the 3D glasses over prescription glasses.

{{% panel status="caution" title="CAUTION" %}}

* To ensure optimal image quality, the system should only be used with Alcon-supplied 3D glasses. Contact Alcon if additional pairs are required. Polarized prescription glasses will distort the 3D effect and should not be used.
* The 3D glasses must be worn in front of the laser protective eyewear to avoid distorting the 3D effect.
