The camera pan function adjusts the alignment of the image without moving the camera or microscope mount. The range of image movement is limited.

The pan function is useful in the following cases:

* In retina cases, where the wide angle lens is not centered in the optical path.
* In minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) procedures when gonioscopy lens image is not centered in optical path.

Use **Ctrl**+**Up**, **Ctrl**+**Right**, **Ctrl**+**Down**, or **Ctrl**+**Left** to electronically move the image.
