For the best 3D effect, place the display next to the patient bed, between 4′ to 6′ (1.2 m to 1.8 m) away from the user. Depending on the display, align either the bottom third or middle of the display perpendicular with the line of sight of the seated user. If necessary, also ensure other viewers have a satisfactory view.
