To calibrate light settings, verify the light temperature and perform the white balance procedure (see Light Profile Settings). Before setting white balance, perform the following checks:

* Set the camera iris slider to normal working conditions for the user. Alcon recommends 30%.
* Set the microscope to maximum zoom.
* Disable any red reflex settings.
* Remove all extraneous devices (for example, beam splitters or invertors).
* Disable any unique microscope filtration or lens settings (for example, laser filters).
* Ensure the microscope is not tiled.
* Set the illumination settings as applicable:
    * For microscopes, turn off all room lights and set the illumination source intensity to normal user working conditions.
    * For endo-illuminators, turn off all room and microscope lights before connecting the endo-illuminator probe and turning on the illumination.
