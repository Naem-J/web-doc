To avoid risk of electric shock, this equipment must only be connected to a supply mains with protective earth (ground). The system should be connected to an uninterruptible power source when loss of power would result in an unacceptable risk.  \r\rCAUTION\rGrounding reliability can only be achieved when equipment is connected to an equivalent receptacle marked ‘Hospital Grade’.\r\r\rNOTICE\rEnsure the camera is connected before turning on the system.\r\r\rTo power the system, perform the following:\n Connect the power cable to a hospital-grade power outlet. Turn on the main power switch. Wait 30 seconds for the system to initialize. The display and software automatically start. Adjust the height, tilt, and distance of the display according to user preferences.
